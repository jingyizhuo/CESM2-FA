# Welcome to CESM2-FA Docs

This is the documentation for **CESM2-FA**, which is the flux adjusted version of a fully coupled climate model (**CESM2**).

## ðŸ”— Resources

- ðŸ“„ [**Paper**](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/38/4/JCLI-D-24-0331.1.xml) â€” Description of the surface flux adjutment method and results
- ðŸŽ¼ [**Code**](https://github.com/jingyizhuo/CESM2-FA/tree/main/code) â€” How to apply flux adjustment to a GCM, taking CESM2 as the example
- ðŸ’¾ [**Data Repository**](https://github.com/jingyizhuo/CESM2-FA/tree/main/data) â€” Output data for CESM2-FA simulations. Input data (flux adjustment terms) and source codes to apply the flux adjustments into CESM2 available upon request.
